## Getting started

### 1. Fork

Fork this repo by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.

### 2. Clone

Go to your GitHub repositories and open your forked repository. Click on the "Clone or download" button and then click the copy to clipboard icon to get your url.

Finally run the following git command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone "the copied url"
```

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/challenges.git
```

### 3. Register the upstream repository

It's useful to have
the upstream repository (the source that you forked) registered as well to be able to stay up to date when new challenges are added.

If you haven't already, start by changing your directory to the challenges repository that was created when you ran `git clone`:

```sh
cd challenges
```

Then add `ollelauribostrom/challenges` as the upstream remote:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ollelauribostrom/challenges.git
```

### 4. Solve a challenge

You are now all set to start solving your first challenge. Each challenge comes with its own set of instructions on how to solve it. Checkout all available challenges [here](/challenges).
